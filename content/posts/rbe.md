In collaboration with the [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/), [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) and [The University of South Florida](http://ucfrejects.com) I am pleased to announce research regarding a new class of vulnerability called Remote Bankruptcy Exploits (RBE).

## Overview

The RBE vulnerability class represents a significant shift in the landscape of cybersecurity threats. Unlike traditional exploits that focus on data theft or system compromise, RBE attacks target the financial stability of startups and small businesses by exploiting the very infrastructure designed to scale their operations.

## How RBE Works

RBE attacks leverage the power of serverless functions and auto-scaling features in cloud environments. By simply using a vulnerable system the startup will be billed leading to their eventual bankruptcy.

## Real-World Implications
The implications of RBE attacks are far-reaching and deeply concerning. Startups, known for their poor financial decisions and making mistakes are more vulnerable.

## Exploitation Steps
1. Google ``blog "serverless" startup``
2. Select a target from the list
3. Make sure the service becomes successful
4. bankruptcy

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against RBE attacks, businesses must,

- Be smart use serverless carefully

## Conclusion

The discovery of the RBE vulnerability class serves as a wake-up call for the tech industry. As we continue to embrace the convenience and scalability of cloud services, we must also remain vigilant in safeguarding our digital and financial assets. Collaboration between industry, academia, and government agencies will be crucial in developing effective defenses against this emerging threat.

Stay tuned for our upcoming white paper, which will provide a comprehensive analysis of RBE exploits and detailed guidelines for prevention and mitigation.
